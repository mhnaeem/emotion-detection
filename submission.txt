Group Project - Emotion Detection Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network

Directory Structure:
   All files for our submission is contained within the emotion-detection directory.

   1. The data directory contains the data set and any other temporary data files
        a. The fer2013.csv file is our dataset

   2. The documents directory contains our documents
        a. The emotion_detection_presentation.pdf file is our group's presentation
        b. The emotion_detection_report.pdf file is our group's report

   3. The out directory contains our outputs
        a. The out.txt file is our console's output from running the training
        b. The emotion_model.h5 is our saved neural network model
        c. The images directory contains all plots, graphs and images pertaining to our model

   4. The src directory contains all source code for this entire project
        a. The data.py file contains code to manage and manipulate the dataset
        b. The demo.py file contains code to run the model against live feed from the webcam
        c. The main.py file is our main code for running all aspects of the application
        d. The model.py file contains code for our model's structure and training
        e. The plots.py file contains code for creating our graphs and plots

Important Notes:

   1. We suggest using Python 3.7 for running this application
   2. To run the code first change current directory to src and then run the main.py file using `python3 ./main.py`
   3. The main.py file has lots of boolean variables that can be changed which part of the code needs to run, please change them for your needs
   4. We suggest having IMPORT_FROM_SCRATCH variable in main.py to be always set to True
   5. Retraining the model using main.py will overwrite the existing saved model
   6. Retraining our model takes approximately ~20 mins
